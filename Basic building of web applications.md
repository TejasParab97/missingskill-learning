### **(1) PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES**
   
   <br>

   $~~~~~$ Some of the most popular programming langauages:-

   * Python
   * Dart
   * Javascript
   * PHP
   * C++
   * Java
   * Swift
   * Ruby

   So, Programming language mainly divided into two types:-

    (1) Javascript , HTML , CSS , etc. are Front end languages.
   
    (2) Java , Python , PHP , etc. are Back end languages.

### **(2) KEY FACTORS OF WEB DEVELOPMENT**

    
 <br>

      (I)$~~$ IP Address (IPv4 / IPv6)

      (II)$~~$ Ports(HTTP / HTTPS)

      (III)$~~$ HTTP Verbs / Headres / Status Codes

      (IV)$~~$ Domain Name / Host

      (V)$~~$ Software License

      (VI)$~~$ Code Repositories

      (VII)$~~$ Cloud Providers


  <br>

### **(3) IP Address**

<br>

   * IP stands for **Internet Protocol**. IP address  provides some regulations or protocols while accessing Internet. Generally, It's a unique identification number assined for each system to access over internet.

   <br>

   * IP Address is combination of numbres and characters.
   >Example:- 189.155.45.3
   <br>
   Here, Each number consists of 8 bit so, IPv4 address is 32 bit.

   <br>

   *  IPv4 is older version of ip address of over 4 billion ip addresses , but the new version of ip address **IPV6**, which can provide trillions of ip addresses.

   <br>

   * IPv4 addresses are combination of numbers , but they are conflict with other ip addresses so, IPv6 addresses uses hexadecimal method.(Combination of numbers and chracters)
   >Example:- 4ggr:1925:5656:7:600:t4tt:tc54:98vt

   <br>

   * Classes of IPv4

        (I) class A

        In class A , ranges from 0 to 127. It's mostly used in local systems.

        (II) class B

        In class B , ranges from 128 to 191. It's used for Internet.

        (III) class C

        In class C , ranges from 192 to 223. It's used in Local Networks.

        (IV) class D

        In class D , ranges from 224 to 239. They are reserved ones.

        (V) class E

        In class E , ranges from 240 to 255. They are not used.


   <br>


  ### **(4) PORTS**

  <br>

  * Port is assigned to IP address. Ip address takes you to machine and port takes you to exact path.
  >IP is like address to your home but,Port is your Building no or Room no.

  <br>

  * There are 65,535 ports available:
    
    * 0 - 1023 :$~$ Reserve ports for system machines.

    * 1024 - 49150 :$~$ Application ports.

    * 49151 - 65535 :$~$ Open ports.

  <br>

  * Port 80 and 443 are HTTP Ports. They are associated with internet.
  port 80 is for HTTP whreas, port 443 is for HTTPS. here, s stands for secure. port 443 allows transmitting internet over secure network.


  <br>

  ### **(5) HTTP VERBS / HEADERS / STATUS CODES**

  <br>

  * **HTTP** stands for _Hyper Text Transfer Protocol_. Http are set of rules or protocols for transmitting text , image , video , etc. files over internet.

  * There are some methods we can use over HTTP to perform specific task they are known as **"HTTP Verbs"**.
  some of the main HTTP Verbs are:

     *  **Get** :- Used to fetch the data from server.
     * **Post / Put** :- Used to send data to server.
     * **Delete** :- Used to delete data from server.
     * **Option / Head** :- Used in queries.

  * To pass additional information from cilent to server there are some HTTP headres:

     * Response Headres:
     holds addtional information about response.
     * Request Headres:
     holds information about resources to be fetched or client requests.

  * When clients make requests on server there are some message comes with status code. Status Codes help usres to identify the problems of server. some of status codes:

      *   100 = Informational Response
      * 200 = Successful Requests
      * 300 = Used for Migration
      * 400 = User Authentication
      * 500 = Server Errors     


  <br>


  ### **(6) DOMAIN NAME / HOST**

  <br>

  * Domain names are key part of Internet. If you want to create your own website , then domain names provides URL for web server to access your website. 

  * Domain names are available in different extensions. **.com**, **.org**, **.net** are some popular Domain names.

  * >Example:- www.amazon.in <br>
  Here, in stands for India.


  <br>


  ### **(7) SOFTWARE LICENSE**

  <br>


  * Software License is like a contract document It,s an Agreement between Developers of Software and Software Users.

  * some of the popular Software Licenses:-

     * Apache 2.0
     * MIT
     * GPL (Linux)
     * BSD
     * Mozilla
