#  Linux

**(1) _HISTORY OF UNIX_**

 * In 1970 , **BellLab** started resrearch on computers. During 1 years of research they created system known as **UNIX**.but , they are very costly.
 * In 1980 , One of the researcher **Richard Stallman** from _MIT UNIVERSITY_ started his research on free software.
 * In 1985 , **Richard Stallman** started Non-Profit Organization names as, **FSR(_Free Software Foundation_)**.

 >Without Free Software Foundation we are unable to learn about different new technologies. That's why **Richard Stallman** known as _Father_ of free software technology.

 **(2) _INTRODUCTION TO LINUX_**

 * In 1990, Finnish (Finland) Scientist named as , **Linus torvalds** doing some research on Maths & Physics , during research He introduced new Kernel known as **Linux**.
 >Kernel is nothing but, core of operating system. 
 * Linux is completely free as well as GNU is free beacause of that, many developers and researchers started to contribute different packages of GNU project.
 * _GNU_ & _LINUX_ came together and they developed **GNU/Linux** O.S. this is the first Operating system on Linux Kernel.

 **(3) _ADVANTAGES OF LINUX_**
 
 1. ###  Free Software Licensing

    * Linux kernel is open source and free so users can use Linux completely free without paying any money.
    * Because of free licensing, Linux os is mostly used in commercial places such as, Schools, I.T. Companies, etc.


2. ### Open Source
   * Linux Kernel(code) is available for everyone. So, programmers can add his own features or modify applications by modifying the source code.
   * Linux is open source that's why many developers stared their own operating system based on Linux
   In  **2020**, almost 99% of technologies working on Linux kernel. currently , there are around **4000** Linux distribtions are avilable in market.
   
   >Distributions are nothing but, Operating Systems.
   
       some of the popular Linux Distributions:-
       
       - Debian
         * Ubuntu
           ~ Linux Mint
         * Kali
         * MX Linux
       - Redhat
         * Fedora
         * CentOS
       - Arch Linux
       - android

3. ### Lag free & More Secure

   * compared to windows operating system, Linux is most lightweight & comfortable for users. You can perform your tasks very smoothly.  
   * Linux is more secure than windows beacuase we can install applications just by passing the command
   e.g.-

       ```
       $ sudo apt insatll package
       ```
       insted of downloading .exe file and then install it in windows.and sometimes .exe file comes with malware or virus. so we can easily insatll application on linux without harm our system.
